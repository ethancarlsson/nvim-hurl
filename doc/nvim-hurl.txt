nvim-hurl.nvim is a plugin that adds various utilities to improve your workflow
when using `.hurl` files.

                                                                *:HurlYank*
:HurlYank
Run a hurl file and yank the results into the `"*` register.

                                                                *:HurlRun*
:HurlRun
Run a hurl file and view the results in a split window scratch file.

                                                                *:HurlRunVerbose*
:HurlRunVerbose
Run a hurl file and view the result and the results of the hurl `--verbose` option
in two seperate scratch files.

                                                                *:Hurlsvf*
:Hurlsvf
Hurl [s]et [v]ariables [f]iles. This command will set the variables file for a
project.

It will generate a file, `.hurl_variable_location`, to keep track of your 
variables. If your using git, consider adding this file to your `.gitignore` file 
or your exclude file with `echo '.hurl_variable_location' >> .git/info/exclude`

                                                                *:Hurlsv*
:Hurlsv
Hurl [s]et [v]ariable. Sets a temporary variable, it is the equivelant to the
command line `--variable` option. It accepts exactly two arguments, the name
of the variable and the variable. `:Hurlsv name value` is equivelant to
`--variable name=value` from the command line.

NOTE: These values will not persist after your session ends.
                                                                *:Hurlvc*
:Hurlvc
Hurl [v]ariables [c]lear. Clear all temporary variables set via `:Hurlsv`.

                                                                *:CurlGo*
:CurlGo
Make a simple GET request, reusing the headers of the previous request. To
prevent reuse of previous headers, use `:CurlGo {url} noreuse`.

                                                                *:CurlGoFromCursor*
:CurlGoFromCursor
Run `CurlGo` running the but using the url directly under the cursor.

NOTE: Will reuse headers unless `noreuse` option is passed to it.
