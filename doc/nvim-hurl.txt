INTRODUCTION                                                    *nvim-hurl.nvim*

nvim-hurl.nvim is a plugin that adds various utilities to improve your workflow
when using .hurl files.

                                                                      *:HurlYank*
:HurlYank
Run a hurl file and yank the results into the "*" register.

                                                                      *:HurlRun*
:HurlRun
Run a hurl file and view the results in a split window scratch file. NOTE:
HurlRun will cut off part of the results if it's very long. For a full result
see :HurlRunFull.

                                                                      *:HurlRunFull*
:HurlRunFull
Run a hurl file and view the results in a split window scratch file. NOTE: This
will get the full result, but will not add any metadata to the scratch file.

You set filetype={filetype} on the scratch file if you need LSP support 
or syntax highlighting. But be warned, for the kind of results where you will 
need the HurlRunFull command LSPs and syntax highlighting might be pretty slow.
