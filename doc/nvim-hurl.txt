INTRODUCTION                                                    *nvim-hurl.nvim*

nvim-hurl.nvim is a plugin that adds various utilities to improve your workflow
when using `.hurl` files.

                                                                *:HurlYank*
:HurlYank
Run a hurl file and yank the results into the `"*` register.

                                                                *:HurlRun*
:HurlRun
Run a hurl file and view the results in a split window scratch file. NOTE:
`HurlRun` will cut off part of the results if it's very long. For a full result
see `:HurlRunFull`.

                                                                *:HurlRunFull*
:HurlRunFull
Run a hurl file and view the results in a split window scratch file. 

NOTE: This will get the full result, but will not add any metadata to the 
scratch file.

You can use `set filetype={filetype}` on the scratch file if you need LSP support 
or syntax highlighting. But be warned, for the kind of results where you will 
need the `HurlRunFull` command LSPs and syntax highlighting might be pretty slow.

                                                                *:Hurlsvf*
:Hurlsvf
Hurl [s]et [v]ariables [f]iles. This command will set the variables file for a
project.

It will generate a file, `.hurl_variable_location`, to keep track of your 
variables. If your using git, consider adding this file to your `.gitignore` file 
or your exclude file with `echo '.hurl_variable_location' >> .git/info/exclude`
